                <h1>AIDEN PEREZ</h1>
                <h4>The Most Interesting Dev in the World</h4><br/>
                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Aiden, a motivated, creative software developer always looking for new opportunities to develop and apply my current skillset.
                    With over five years in programming to build up a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming,
                    I am confident in my abilities to efficiently solve nearly any complex problem. Rather than reviewing the same subjects semester after semester,
                    I branched out to gain experience in a variety of technologies, with each decreasing the time it takes to reach fluency.
                    This exposure coupled with unique life experiences has made me a feared opponent in any realm of human endeavor.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>
                    Some life experiences that fall outside the norm of a typical CS student include working in teams my entire life and as an entertainer.
                    Playing hockey for over 15 years made me extremely comfortable working and excelling in teams. It also provided valuable leadership experience
                    after being chosen as the captain of my varsity team for 2 years. Throughout constantly rallying a group of 20 teenagers and their parents, my 
                    communication skills drastically improved. Desiring to hone the ability more, I chose to take up odd jobs in college. Working as a trivia host
                    and kayak tour guide led to better confidence in speaking to large groups of people, thinking on the fly, and creatively portraying thoughts
                    to keep people engaged.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>
                    While speaking and programming are fantastic creative outlets, they don't nearly satisfy my itch, hence my shameless link to my soundcloud
                    in the top right corner there. Thanks for reading until the end despite this being longer than a tiktok :).
                </p>

                        <h2>Space Invaders Ovedrive</h2>
                        <p>
                            Quick experimentation with pygame to make a version of space invaders where
                            the user can move all four directions rather than 2, and make the ships slightly
                            harder. Powerups are also in the game, with users being able to hit certain targets
                            after an interval to gain extra lasers.

                            A personal web assistant application, meant to help users
                            track their goals, finances, nutrition, as well as providing
                            grocery deals near them. Built responsively, it will be as easily accessed
                            as an app in todays world.

                            One intriguing idea would be to take the finance and location data to show users
                            if they could potentially qualify for government assistance programs. Additional
                            ideas are hopefully coming down the pipeline, especially when users are able to
                            give feedback as to what more they would desire from the service.
